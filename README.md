# Previder Powershell Module
The Previder Powershell Module can be used to interact with resources on the Previder IaaS environment. 
The provider needs to be configured with an API token. This token can be acquired by loggin in and navigationg to your user setting page.

## Example Usage

```
Import-Module Previder-Powershell-Module
Connect-Annexus -Token <token>
Get-VmList
New-Vm -Name "Virtual Server 01" -Cluster "express" -Template "centos8" -CpuCores 2 -MemoryMb 4048 -Nics @("Public WAN") -Disks @(20480) -Tags @()
Wait-VmDeploy -Name "Virtual Server 01"
Invoke-VmConsole -Name "Virtual Server 01"
$vm = Get-Vm -Name "Virtual Server 01"
Invoke-Vm -Name "Virtual Server 01" -Action "POWEROFF"
$task = Set-Vm -Id $vm.id -cpuCores 4
Wait-VmTask -Task $task
$task = Invoke-Vm -Name "Virtual Server 01" -Action "POWERON"
Wait-VmTask -Task $task
```

## Argument reference

The following arguments are supported

### Connect-Annexus

*(Either Token or Accountname and Username are required)*
- Token -  This is your personal API token for accessing resources in the Previder IaaS environment.
- Accountname - This is your accountname
- Username - Enter the username with which to login
- Password - Enter the plain-text password required for the account configure above
- OTP - If OTP is enabled on this account, use this field to send the challenge code
- UseOTP - Required when manually sending your OTP challenge code
- Uri - Only used when connecting to an alternative environment (defaults to https://portal.previder.nl/api)

### Set-AnnexusRateLimitHandling

Change how this module handles hitting the API rate limit for the Annexus API.

- WaitForRateLimitReset -  $true/$false (defaults to true). Defines wether the module should delay requests if the rate limit is about to be hit. If this is set to false, hitting the rate limit will throw an error.  
- RateLimitWaitThreshold - Number (0-1500, default 100). When the remaining amount of requests allowed is below this value and WaitForRateLimitReset is set to true, the module will wait until the rate limit is reset.
